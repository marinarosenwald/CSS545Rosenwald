1. Intended platform for final project: iOS
2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project: Swift in XCode
3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development: I think it would be interesting to explore cross platform development. 
4. Include a brief explanation for your selections: I have an iPhone and a MacBook Pro, so making an iOS application in Swift using XCode is what is most convenient for me. Also, I think that the hardware features in the new iPhones are interesting and I would enjoy experimenting with them. For example, the new iPhone Pros have LiDAR sensors in them which are fun to play with. I have experience using Kivy to make a cross-platform application, but I think it would be interesting to learn about other libraries and tools as well.
